I

80
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,119
didn't

81
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:32,299
think

82
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:32,500
so.

83
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:33,280
Next

84
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,579
is

85
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:33,960
cat

86
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,380

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,100
I

97
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,219
think

98
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:37,340
it's

99
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:37,500
pretty

100
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:37,780
obvious

101
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,039
why.

102
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:38,539
It's

103
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:38,600
a

104
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:38,780
cat

105
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,119
sitting

106
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:39,299
like

107
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:39,439
a

108
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:39,700
human.

109
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:40,399
And

110
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:40,579
there's

111
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:40,659
a

112
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:41,079
translated

113
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:41,380
poem

114
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:41,539
in

115
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:41,560
the

116
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:41,820
description

117
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,200
that

118
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,320
is

119
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,500
worth

120
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,759
reading.

121
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:43,520
And

122
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:43,899
finally,

123
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,140

124
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,280

127
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,460
better

128
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:45,600
