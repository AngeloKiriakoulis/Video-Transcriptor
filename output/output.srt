1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
Today I'm going

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:00,820
to tell you

3
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,540
some stories about

4
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:01,860
cats.

5
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,640
So here's your

6
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,259
one-time edition

7
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:04,059
of Cat News,

8
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,759
depending on how

9
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,240
many hits it

10
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,500
gets.

11
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:06,860
Yeah!

12
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,480
Over the past

13
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,099
week, we've had

14
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:09,839
some great cat

15
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:10,740
material on the

16
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:10,800
internet.

17
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,380
First off, collective

18
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,220
soul cat,

19
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,140
with over 1

20
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,220
million views on

21
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:15,619
YouTube.

22
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,559
Now, you might

23
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,420
remember bumping this

24
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:17,839
track in your

25
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:18,579
geo-tracker sometime

26
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:18,920
in the mid

27
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,480
-90s,

28
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,120
but did your

29
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,839
cat ever ride

30
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:21,600
shotgun and sing

31
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:21,920
along?

32
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:32,420
I didn't think

33
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:32,939
so.

34
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,119
Next is Cat

35
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:34,979
Sitting Relax.

36
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:35,880
This one's got

37
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,619
over 4 million

38
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,159
views, and I

39
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:37,659
think it's pretty

40
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:38,219
obvious what.

41
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:38,960
It's a cat

42
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,659
sitting like a

43
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:39,859
human.

44
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:40,820
And there's a

45
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,619
translated poem in

46
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:42,299
the description that

47
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:42,840
is worth reading.

48
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,200
And finally, can

49
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,280
you imagine anything

50
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,859
better than an

51
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:46,619
impromptu-trip to

52
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:47,200
Disney World?

53
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:47,979
How about getting

54
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:48,679
to Orlando and

55
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,280
finding a cat

56
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,979
in your suitcase?

57
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,020
Well, according to

58
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,939
WKMG, that's what

59
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:53,460
happened to Ethel

60
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,719
Mace.

61
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:54,359
She was packing

62
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:54,920
up her suitcase

63
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,640
and Ohio to

64
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,159
go to Florida,

65
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:57,159
and her kitty

66
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,359
named Bob Bob,

67
00:00:58,679 --> 00:00:59,399
climbed inside without

68
00:00:59,399 --> 00:00:59,799
her knowing.

69
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,500
Ethel went to

70
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,000
the airport and

71
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,640
checked her bag,

72
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,399
and when she

73
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:02,979
got to Disney

74
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,340
World,

75
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,439
she discovered Bob,

76
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,939
soaking wet, and

77
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:06,359
then she let

78
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:06,840
the cat out

79
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,180
of the bag.

80
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:08,260
What a wacky

81
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,680
story!

82
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,379
I'll leave you

83
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:09,799
with a reminder

84
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,500
to please pick

85
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,040
up your copy

86
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,000
of Dancing With

87
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,379
Cats.

88
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,120
Thank you.
